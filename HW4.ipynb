Do remember to allow traffic on the same for gcloud (like you did for previous assignment). You can see various metrics depending on what you want to track like loss, accuracy, validation loss and validation accuracy over epochs. Attach the plots of loss and accuracy from the tensorboard display in the notebook"

    "You would've observed that the summaries are not yet perfect. This is because in encoder decoder architecture, only the final state of encoder is used to calculate the probabilities. We now move to a more general approach called attention based approach. In this, we take a weighted sum of all weights of encoder instead of just the last one. You are already provided an attention_decoder.py file with AttentionDecoder. Add this layer on top of your encoder and run the same experiment as before. For this part, you don't need to worry about return_probabilities argument to create_UniLSTMwithAttention function. Just pass it as an argument to your attention decoder layer. When return_probabilities is false, the attention decoder returns prediction model, which is what you need for this part of the assignment. When return_probabilities is true, the attention decoder returns the probability model, which you will be using later in the Analysis part of this assignment"

    "In the attention map, whenever the model has a lighter color, it means that that that particular word on y-axis is correlated to word on x-axis. \n",

    "* Good Examples     \n",
    "From the good examples, we found out most of them are related to finance such as stock, shares and market, since they are more structured compared to others. For the first sentence, the input sentence is \"the australian dollar closed higher tuesday as the us dollar went weaker\", while the predicted summary is \"australian dollar closes higher\". The word \"dollar\" in the input is correlated to the phrase \"australian dollar\" with \"dollar\" included, while \"higher\" predicts \"closes higher\", which maintains the original meaning.\n",
    "Based on the second sentence, the first line of the article is “chinext stocks declined #.## points to open at #,###.## points on Friday”, while the decoded summary is “chinext index opens lower Friday”. We found out that the word “stocks” in the article corresponds to “chinext index” paraphrase in the output, which makes sense. The word “percent” is correlated to “opens lower”, while “####.##” is correlated to “Friday”. \n",
    "In the input sentence “germany’s stocks opened mixed on Monday on the Frankfurt stock exchange”, the phrase “open mixed” corresponds to “mixed” in the input. Moreover, “exchange” predicts “german stocks”, where it is more correlated to “german” than to “stocks”. But generally speaking, “stocks” should be more related to “exchange”.\n",
    "In the fourth example, most of the words in the output are extracted from the input sequence. However, the word ”share” is correlated to “closed”, which is a little bit weird.\n",
    "For the fifth sentence, this case is similar to the last sentence. Nevertheless, the “share” in the output corresponds “kong” from “hong kong”, a proper noun, which seems to be an issue. In addition, the verb phrase “close generally lower” all refers to the same word “lower”.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bad Examples    \n",
    "From the attention weight plots of bad examples, there are always a bunch of words correlated by one or two words in the input, which suggests that the attention weights of the system does not work well for the examples. For instance, in the first sentence, there are a few unknown words predicted by the word \"hear\" in the input according the value of attention weights, while the two \"without\"s are predicted by \"Saturday\" in the article.     \n",
    "In the second sentence, the first part of the output, \"powerful feels\" is predicted by the word \"policeman\", while the second half of the output get higher weight in the word \"easy\", which does not make much sense.   \n",
    "For the third sentence, it is the word \"ever\" that gets the higher weight for most of the words in the output. \n",
    "For the fourth sentence, the three \"crisis\" in the end of the output are correlated to \"crisis\" in input, which demonstrates extraction from input. In addition, the first half of the input with some repetitive words, which is not syntactically\n",
    "fluent, is softly aligned with the word \"tax\".    \n",
    "For the fifth sentence, I found out the whole sentence is softly aligned with a single word \"has\". In conclusion, the soft alignment between the input and generated output does not seem reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Examples   \n",
    "From the random examples, the attention weights work well for some sentences, such as the second sentence \"the guantanamo bay detention center will not close today or any day soon\", where there is still a word \"guantanamo\" corresponded to the \"bay\" in the input. However, the attention map does not seem to apply well in the other sentences, like the first, third, fourth sentences, in which all the n-grams in th input are only correlated to a single word.\n"

    "repetition of words,\n",
    "ungrammaticality, syntactic problems such as attachment which make the resulting summary syntactically\n",
    "fluent but semantically incorrect, reference issues (e.g., using pronouns that are not resolved or NP\n",
    "references that are incorrect), wrong phrases dropped from the sentence, improper handling of proper\n",
    "nouns, etc. Also note how much abstraction vs. extraction your system does. Is your system making\n",
    "lexical substitutions, generalizing, compressing?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with the Models\n",
    "The plain lstm model I created is using the teacher forcing method to ignore the previous timestep predicted word, and instead use as input, the previous timestep word from gold title, which is usally better than the non teacher forcing method.   \n",
    "In the second model, we used attention in the encoder-decoder model. Instead of decoding the input sequence into a single fixed context vector, the attention model develops a context vector that is filtered specifically for each output time step. From the paper, we know that each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with these source positions and all the previous generated target words.    \n",
    "\n",
    "From the training evaluation process, we found out that attention model takes longer and more memory to train the model, but ideally it performs more accurate in generating the title summaries. It can be discovered and validated from the result table. Though the two models both perform well in sentences related to stock and finance, the model attention shows better result, as it is able to capture prep. and adv. phrases. For instance, in the second sentence for the good example, lstm model with attention has captured the prep. word \"friday\" from the input text, which provides more detail compared to the plain lstm model.\n",
    "In terms of the abstraction vs. extraction, lstm with attention model are more likely to generate words and phrases that do not exist in the input. For example, in the random example \"Bailey a. Thomas, the chairman and chief executive of the mccormick co\", the model with attention is able to generate the occupation of the subject body, \"ceo\", from the input text phrases including \"the chairman\" and \"chief executive\". On the other hand, the plain lstm model tend to extract tokens from the input. In the sentence \"the french presidency says esteemed martinique poet aime cesaire has died\", the plain lstm model could extract the subject body of the sentence \"french presidency\", while the model with attention has generated a name \"Jean-Philippe\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the decoded outputs, we do see some cases with lexical substitutions, generalizing and compressing, especially lexical substitutions. In some financial-related articles, \"lower\" is replaced with \"down\", while \"share\" is substituted by \"stock\". For instance, the title \"london share prices down at midday\" is predicted by the article \"share prices on the london stock exchange were lower at midday thursday\", where the original \"lower\" has changed to the word \"down\" with the lexical and sementical meaning remaining the same. In terms of generalizing and compression, for the article \"germany 's benchmark stock index gained , boosted by thyssen ag and fried\", it got truncated the second half part, just retaining the major impact of the sentence \"germany 's stock index gained\", regardless of the plain lstm model or model with attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems and Proposal  \n",
    "1) Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few issues appearing the summarization process including ungrammaticality, repetition of words, reproducing factual details inaccurately, and wrong sentence parsing, out of which the issue of repetition of words is the most severe one. For example, for the fourth article-summary pair, we have a bunch of \"economic\" and \"is\" in the decoded output from plain lstm model, while we have three words \"battle\", \"side\" and \"crisis\" repeated in the summary predicted by the model with attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of incorrect sentence parsing, in the article \"the french presidency says esteemed martinique poet aime cesaire has died\", both models captured the meaning \"the french president dies\", which is obviously wrong, since the misunderstood the verb phrase \"has died\" should be attached after the proper name \"aime cesaire\" instead of \"french president\".\n",
    "As for ungrammaticality, it takes place all the time if the articles are not financial or not structured enough. In the article \"it 's one of the oldest rivalries in soccer : belgium vs. the netherlands\", the reference title should be \"<unk> rivalries rarely get any better or older than\", while we predicted \"italy defeats growth doubles italy in italy in denmark cup netherlands\", which is grammatically incorrect. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   In addition, we have summaries syntactically fluent but semantically incorrect.\n",
    "In the second sentence from the random examples, we get \"radjia gets moving spots with lakers\" from the model with impact, which is significantly different from its original meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Last but not least, we have cases, which predict the location, time and change completely different or even opposite in the output. For the article \"this is the cox news service spot news budget for friday , june # , ####\", both of the models capture the main body \"the news service service news budget\". Furthermore, the attention model even generates the time and date, but unfortunately the time it predicted is Thursday not Friday.\n",

    "2) Proposal      \n",
    "Since the problem of repetition of words is the most severe one, I come up with a few approaches to deal with it. Repetition may be caused by the decoder’s over-reliance on the decoder input (i.e. previous summary word), rather than storing longer-term information in the decoder state. This can be seen by the fact that a single repeated word commonly triggers an endless repetitive cycle. \n",
    "To tackle repetitive summaries, we could use a technique called coverage, which is also used in the state of the art model for summarization, Pointer Generator. The idea is that we use the attention distribution to keep track of what’s been covered so far, and penalize the network for attending to same parts again. \n",
    "On each timestep t of the decoder, the coverage vector $c^{{t}}$ is the sum of all the attention distributions $a^{{t}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the coverage of a particular source word is equal to the amount of attention it has received so far.\n",
    "$$c^{{t}} = \\sum_{t=0}^{t-1}a^{{t}} $$\n",
    "Lastly, we introduce an extra loss term to penalize any overlap between the coverage vector and the new attention distribution:\n",
    "In this way, it discourages the network from attending to anything that is already been covered.\n",
    "$$covloss_{t} = \\sum_{i}min(a_{i}^{{t}},c_{i}^{{t}})  $$"
